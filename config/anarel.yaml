# Maintain the packages we want to install into a miniconda anarel environment.
# support variants on a anarel, like anarel-py3 anarel-gpu

# the format of this file is
# -  list of stage 1 packages
# -  list of stage 2 packages, ect
#
# after each stage, ana-rel-manage will test the new packages just installed, as well as
# retest the previous packages installed. In this was we can see 
# if installing some later package causes problems for an earlier package.

# each stage is a list of packages. We can specify a version, and then a full package
# build string for different variants, or specify that we should skip a package for
# a given variant. We can also specify a channel for channels not in the condarc files

# ana-rel-manage will add the appropriate python version when creating, so we don't
# list python below.

# syntax for a package
#  packagename:
#    ver: '=1.0.0'  or '>=1.0' or latest, note we need '' around the specification, and
#         we need to start numbers with = or >, latest means just let conda get the latest
#         version of the package
#    py3ver: '=1.0.1' if for some reason the python three installation requires a different
#                     version, specify it here 
#    bld: lfs_verbs_100   full package build string, for the default py27 opt anarelease
#    dbg: blah            likewise for the py27 debug release
#    gpu: blah            likewise for the gpu py27 opt release
#    py3: blah            likwise fot eh py3 opt release
#                     you can also put the string skip here, important for py3
#    chl: the channel to find the package in, fully qualified file urls, or off of anaconda for things
#         like conda-forge, ect, only needed if channel is not in condarc
